Diseases under the umbrella term heart disease include: • Cardiovascular disease. • Heart arrhythmia. • Congenital heart disease.  • Cardiomyopathy. • Heart disease caused by heart infections. • Heart valve disease.  Symptoms:  Heart disease symptoms vary depending on which type of heart diseases you have.  Cardiovascular disease: Cardiovascular disease can result in narrowed or blocked blood vessels that restrict blood circulation to the heart, brain, or other parts of the body. Symptoms of cardiovascular disease include: • Coronary artery disease - a disease affecting the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients.  • Cerebrovascular disease - a disease affecting the blood vessels supplying the brain. • Peripheral artery disease - a disease affecting the blood vessels supplying the arms and legs. • Rheumatic heart disease - damage to the heart muscle and heart valves resulting from rheumatic fever, which is caused by an infection from streptococcal bacteria. • Congenital heart disease - heart defects that are observed at birth."

//                     "• Pulmonary embolism - blood clots that come from leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs. Heart attacks and strokes are dangerous medical conditions that are mainly caused by a blockage that prevents blood from flowing to the heart or brain. The most common reason for this blockage is a build-up of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the blood vessels that supply the heart or brain. Strokes can also be caused by bleeding from a blood vessel in the brain or from blood clots.    What Are the Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease? The most important behavioral risk factors leading to heart disease and strokes are: • An unhealthy diet. • Physical inactivity. • Smoking. • Alcohol consumption. • High blood pressure. • Diabetes. • High blood cholesterol and fat levels. • Obesity.   What Are Common Symptoms of Cardiovascular Diseases? Often, there are no symptoms or warning signs that indicate that a person is suffering from a cardiovascular disease. A heart attack or stroke may be the first warning sign or indicator of the disease.   Symptoms of a Heart Attack Include: • Pain or discomfort in the center of the chest. • Pain or discomfort in the arms, the left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back."
