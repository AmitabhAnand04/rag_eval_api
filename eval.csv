Heart attacks and strokes are dangerous medical conditions that are mainly caused by a blockage that prevents blood from flowing to the heart or brain. The most common reason for this blockage is a build-up of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the blood vessels that supply the heart or brain. Strokes can also be caused by bleeding from a blood vessel in the brain or from blood clots.    What Are the Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease? The most important behavioral risk factors leading to heart disease and strokes are: • An unhealthy diet. • Physical inactivity. • Smoking. • Alcohol consumption. • High blood pressure. • Diabetes. • High blood cholesterol and fat levels. • Obesity.   What Are Common Symptoms of Cardiovascular Diseases? Often, there are no symptoms or warning signs that indicate that a person is suffering from a cardiovascular disease. A heart attack or stroke may be the first warning sign or indicator of the disease.   Symptoms of a Heart Attack Include: • Pain or discomfort in the center of the chest. • Pain or discomfort in the arms, the left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back.']","A pulmonary embolism is a condition where blood clots come from leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer,Response for pulmonary embolism
